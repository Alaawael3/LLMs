# Ask My Companyâ€™s Chatbot

A conversational AI chatbot built with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://ai.google.dev/), FAISS vector search, and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to intelligently answer company-specific FAQs. The model answers questions based solely on a provided CSV knowledge base and avoids hallucinations by responding with "I don't know" when context is insufficient.
