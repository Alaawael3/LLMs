Let me start by going through the information given.\n\nShe has a history of involuntary urine loss when she coughs or sneezes, but she doesn't leak at night. That makes me think about possible causes. Involuntary leakage during these activities is often related to stress incontinence, which usually involves the urethra and bladderneck. But since she doesn't leak at night, it's less likely to be related to genuine urinary retention or overactive bladder, which typically affects nighttime.\n\nShe underwent a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. I'm not exactly sure what the Q-tip test entails, but I think it's used to check for urethral obstruction. If the Q-tip remains in the urethra after coughing, it might indicate obstruction, which could be due to a urethral stricture, tumor, or other narrowing. But if it falls out easily, it suggests there's no obstruction.\n\nNow, considering her symptoms, if the Q-tip test shows that the catheter stays in the urethra (indicating obstruction), that would point towards a urethral issue. However, if it's not obstructed, then the problem is more likely in the bladder. In that case, the cystometry would show if there's an overactive bladder or if there's residual volume from incomplete emptying.\n\nWait, but she doesn\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Setup","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Updated training prompt style to add </think> tag \ntrain_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. \nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request. \nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning. \nPlease answer the following medical question. \n\n### Question:\n{}\n\n### Response:\n<think>\n{}\n</think>\n{}\"\"\"\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-21T14:23:59.566050Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-21T14:23:59.566777Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-21T14:23:59.571240Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-21T14:23:59.566753Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-21T14:23:59.570681Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data= load_dataset(\"FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT\",\"en\", split = \"train[0:500]\",trust_remote_code=True) # Keep only first 500 rows","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-21T14:24:18.332360Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-21T14:24:18.332921Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-21T14:24:19.148371Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-21T14:24:18.332895Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-21T14:24:19.147539Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-21T14:24:24.547365Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-21T14:24:24.548063Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-21T14:24:24.553662Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-21T14:24:24.548039Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-21T14:24:24.552954Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":30,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"Dataset({\n    features: ['Question', 'Complex_CoT', 'Response'],\n    num_rows: 500\n})"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":30},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data['Question'][0],'\\n\\n\\n',data['Complex_CoT'][0],'\\n\\n\\n',data['Response'][0])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-21T14:26:45.567602Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-21T14:26:45.568096Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-21T14:26:45.580427Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-21T14:26:45.568074Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-21T14:26:45.579691Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"A 61-year-old woman with a long history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing but no leakage at night undergoes a gynecological exam and Q-tip test. Based on these findings, what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions? \n\n\n Okay, let's think about this step by step. There's a 61-year-old woman here who's been dealing with involuntary urine leakages whenever she's doing something that ups her abdominal pressure like coughing or sneezing. This sounds a lot like stress urinary incontinence to me. Now, it's interesting that she doesn't have any issues at night; she isn't experiencing leakage while sleeping. This likely means her bladder's ability to hold urine is fine when she isn't under physical stress. Hmm, that's a clue that we're dealing with something related to pressure rather than a bladder muscle problem. \n\nThe fact that she underwent a Q-tip test is intriguing too. This test is usually done to assess urethral mobility. In stress incontinence, a Q-tip might move significantly, showing urethral hypermobility. This kind of movement often means there's a weakness in the support structures that should help keep the urethra closed during increases in abdominal pressure. So, that's aligning well with stress incontinence.\n\nNow, let's think about what would happen during cystometry. Since stress incontinence isn't usually about sudden bladder contractions, I wouldn't expect to see involuntary detrusor contractions during this test. Her bladder isn't spasming or anything; it's more about the support structure failing under stress. Plus, she likely empties her bladder completely because stress incontinence doesn't typically involve incomplete emptying. So, her residual volume should be pretty normal. \n\nAll in all, it seems like if they do a cystometry on her, it will likely show a normal residual volume and no involuntary contractions. Yup, I think that makes sense given her symptoms and the typical presentations of stress urinary incontinence. \n\n\n Cystometry in this case of stress urinary incontinence would most likely reveal a normal post-void residual volume, as stress incontinence typically does not involve issues with bladder emptying.

We've got a 61-year-old woman with a history of involuntary urine loss. That usually means she's experiencing some kind of bladder control issue, like a weak pelvic floor or maybe some nerve damage affecting her bladder control. But she's not losing urine at night, which is interesting. It suggests that she's not having any leakage when she's lying down, maybe because her bladder doesn't get full during the night.\n\nNow, she's undergoing a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. The Q-tip test is a standard way to check for urethral obstruction. It involves inserting a catheter and then pulling it back to see how far it can be withdrawn without resistance. If it's easy to pull out, it usually means there's no obstruction. If it's hard, we might suspect some kind of obstruction or blockage.\n\nGiven that she's got a history of involuntary loss, we're looking for a bladder that might not be contracting well, especially when she coughs or sneezes. That sounds like a possible issue with the detrusor muscle not contracting properly, which is called detrusor dysfunction.\n\nNow, when we think about cystometry, it's a test that looks at how the bladder behaves under different conditions. It can show whether the bladder is emptying properly or if there's any obstruction. It also checks how much residual volume is left in the bladder after emptying.\n\nIf we think about her situation, the fact that she's leaking when she coughs or sneezes might mean her bladder isn't contracting well. That's what we call detrusor dysfunction. And if the detrusor isn't contracting properly, it's like a weak muscle not responding when it's supposed to push the urine out.\n\nSo, if the detrusor isn't contracting well, what does that mean for her cystometry results? It should show that there's a significant residual volume, meaning she's not emptying her bladder completely when she should. And there might be some issue with the detrusor contractions themselves, showing that they're not as strong as they should be.\n\nPutting it all together, if we've got a woman with this kind of bladder control problem, the cystometry would likely show that she's got a lot of residual volume and that the detrusor isn't contracting properly. That fits with what we know about her condition and the tests we've done.\n</think>\nBased on the information provided, the cystometry would most likely reveal a significant residual volume in the bladder and evidence of detrusor dysfunction. The woman's history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing suggests that her detrusor muscle is not contracting properly. Additionally, the Q-tip test, which assesses urethral obstruction, would likely not show obstruction since she is not experiencing obstruction symptoms. Therefore, the expected findings in cystometry would be a large residual volume and impaired detrusor contractions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":71},{"cell_type":"code","source":"question=\"\"\"A 21-year-old woman with coughing and sneezing\"\"\"\nquestion=prompt_style.format(question,\"\")\n\ninput_tokens=tokenizer([question],return_tensors='pt').to('cuda')\noutput=model.generate(\n    input_ids=input_tokens.input_ids,\n    attention_mask=input_tokens.attention_mask,\n    max_new_tokens=1000,\n    use_cache=True,\n)\n\nresponse=tokenizer.batch_decode(output)\nprint(response[0].split('### Response:')[1])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-21T15:54:59.230939Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-21T15:54:59.231161Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-21T15:55:36.852762Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-21T15:54:59.231146Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-21T15:55:36.852080Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n<think>\nAlright, so we've got a 21-year-old woman who's been coughing and sneezing. That sounds like it could be a respiratory infection, like maybe a cold or flu. She's coughing, which is pretty common with those kinds of infections. Sneezing also fits right in with respiratory issues, especially if it's something like the flu or rhinosinusitis.\n\nHmm, I should think about what's going on with her. The sneezing and coughing could mean she's dealing with something like rhinosinusitis, which can happen when the nasal passages get infected. That can spread down to the throat and cause coughing. It's not uncommon for people to have both sneezing and coughing when they have a sinus infection.\n\nNow, let's think about her symptoms. She's coughing and sneezing, which are pretty standard for a respiratory infection. But there are other things we need to consider. Are there any other symptoms that could help us figure out what's going on? Maybe she's also having a fever or a sore throat? That would make sense if it's a respiratory infection.\n\nWait, what about her age? She's 21, which is young, so it's possible she's dealing with something like the flu or a common cold. But if she's coughing and sneezing, it could also be an allergic reaction. Allergies are pretty common, and they can cause sneezing and coughing too.\n\nHmm, it's a bit tricky. Let's consider what she's not showing. If she's not having a fever or sore throat, it's less likely to be a bacterial infection like pneumonia or sinusitis. But if she does have a fever, that could point more towards a bacterial infection.\n\nOkay, so she's coughing and sneezing, which are both pretty general symptoms. But without more specific info, it's hard to tell. Maybe she's just dealing with a common cold or flu. Or it could be something like seasonal allergies, which can also cause sneezing and coughing.\n\nI guess the best thing to do is to suggest she should check in with a doctor. That way, they can get a better picture of what's going on with her symptoms and make sure it's not something more serious that needs treatment.\n</think>\nThe symptoms of coughing and sneezing in a 21-year-old woman could be indicative of a respiratory infection, such as a cold or flu, or potentially an allergic reaction. Given that she is young and these symptoms are common in respiratory infections, it's important to consider whether she might be experiencing a bacterial infection like pneumonia or sinusitis, especially if she has a fever or sore throat. However, without specific symptoms or additional information, it's challenging to determine the exact cause.
